## Reporting a Vulnerability

Send all data available that partains to the vulnerability to:
vulns@whompy.org. I am a ONE MAN Operation here so please be patient. I will 
Work them in this order:  

   1.Critical  2.Severe 3.Urgent 4.High 5.Low 

If none of those apply then it is in date:time aka F.C.F.S deal. So I would advise a 
digitally signed or timestamped bug/vulnerability report. To secure and define your place 
in my order. I will get to it as fast as I humanly can. OR you can refer to "http://wtfpl.net/about"
for further information and help. (This a personal beta project in the first place, its why I have 
it licensed under the WTFPL in the first place)
