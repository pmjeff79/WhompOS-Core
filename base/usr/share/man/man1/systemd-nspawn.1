systemd-nspawn \- Spawn a namespace container for debugging, testing and building
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR [OPTIONS...] [\fICOMMAND\fR\ [ARGS...]]
.HP \w'\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR\ 'u
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR \-\-boot [OPTIONS...] [ARGS...]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
may be used to run a command or OS in a light\-weight namespace container\&. In many ways it is similar to
\fBchroot\fR(1), but more powerful since it fully virtualizes the file system hierarchy, as well as the process tree, the various IPC subsystems and the host and domain name\&.
.PP
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
may be invoked on any directory tree containing an operating system tree, using the
\fB\-\-directory=\fR
command line option\&. By using the
\fB\-\-machine=\fR
option an OS tree is automatically searched for in a couple of locations, most importantly in
/var/lib/machines, the suggested directory to place container images installed on the system\&.
.PP
In contrast to
\fBchroot\fR(1)\ \&\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
may be used to boot full Linux\-based operating systems in a container\&.
.PP
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
limits access to various kernel interfaces in the container to read\-only, such as
/sys,
/proc/sys
or
/sys/fs/selinux\&. The host\*(Aqs network interfaces and the system clock may not be changed from within the container\&. Device nodes may not be created\&. The host system cannot be rebooted and kernel modules may not be loaded from within the container\&.
.PP
Use a tool like
\fBdnf\fR(8),
\fBdebootstrap\fR(8), or
\fBpacman\fR(8)
to set up an OS directory tree suitable as file system hierarchy for
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
containers\&. See the Examples section below for details on suitable invocation of these commands\&.
.PP
As a safety check
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
will verify the existence of
/usr/lib/os\-release
or
/etc/os\-release
in the container tree before starting the container (see
\fBos-release\fR(5))\&. It might be necessary to add this file to the container tree manually if the OS of the container is too old to contain this file out\-of\-the\-box\&.
.PP
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
may be invoked directly from the interactive command line or run as system service in the background\&. In this mode each container instance runs as its own service instance; a default template unit file
systemd\-nspawn@\&.service
is provided to make this easy, taking the container name as instance identifier\&. Note that different default options apply when
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
is invoked by the template unit file than interactively on the command line\&. Most importantly the template unit file makes use of the
\fB\-\-boot\fR
which is not the default in case
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
is invoked from the interactive command line\&. Further differences with the defaults are documented along with the various supported options below\&.
.PP
The
\fBmachinectl\fR(1)
tool may be used to execute a number of operations on containers\&. In particular it provides easy\-to\-use commands to run containers as system services using the
systemd\-nspawn@\&.service
template unit file\&.
.PP
Along with each container a settings file with the
\&.nspawn
suffix may exist, containing additional settings to apply when running the container\&. See
\fBsystemd.nspawn\fR(5)
for details\&. Settings files override the default options used by the
systemd\-nspawn@\&.service
template unit file, making it usually unnecessary to alter this template file directly\&.
.PP
Note that
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
will mount file systems private to the container to
/dev,
/run
and similar\&. These will not be visible outside of the container, and their contents will be lost when the container exits\&.
.PP
Note that running two
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
containers from the same directory tree will not make processes in them see each other\&. The PID namespace separation of the two containers is complete and the containers will share very few runtime objects except for the underlying file system\&. Use
\fBmachinectl\fR(1)\*(Aqs
\fBlogin\fR
or
\fBshell\fR
commands to request an additional login session in a running container\&.
.PP
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
implements the
\m[blue]\fBContainer Interface\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2
specification\&.
.PP
While running, containers invoked with
\fBsystemd\-nspawn\fR
are registered with the
\fBsystemd-machined\fR(8)
service that keeps track of running containers, and provides programming interfaces to interact with them\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
If option
\fB\-b\fR
is specified, the arguments are used as arguments for the init binary\&. Otherwise,
\fICOMMAND\fR
specifies the program to launch in the container, and the remaining arguments are used as arguments for this program\&. If
\fB\-\-boot\fR
is not used and no arguments are specified, a shell is launched in the container\&.
.PP
The following options are understood:
.PP
\fB\-D\fR, \fB\-\-directory=\fR
.RS 4
Directory to use as file system root for the container\&.
.sp
If neither
\fB\-\-directory=\fR, nor
\fB\-\-image=\fR
is specified the directory is determined by searching for a directory named the same as the machine name specified with
\fB\-\-machine=\fR\&. See
\fBmachinectl\fR(1)
section "Files and Directories" for the precise search path\&.
.sp
If neither
\fB\-\-directory=\fR,
\fB\-\-image=\fR, nor
\fB\-\-machine=\fR
are specified, the current directory will be used\&. May not be specified together with
\fB\-\-image=\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-template=\fR
.RS 4
Directory or
"btrfs"
subvolume to use as template for the container\*(Aqs root directory\&. If this is specified and the container\*(Aqs root directory (as configured by
\fB\-\-directory=\fR) does not yet exist it is created as
"btrfs"
snapshot (if supported) or plain directory (otherwise) and populated from this template tree\&. Ideally, the specified template path refers to the root of a
"btrfs"
subvolume, in which case a simple copy\-on\-write snapshot is taken, and populating the root directory is instant\&. If the specified template path does not refer to the root of a
"btrfs"
subvolume (or not even to a
"btrfs"
file system at all), the tree is copied (though possibly in a copy\-on\-write scheme \(em if the file system supports that), which can be substantially more time\-consuming\&. May not be specified together with
\fB\-\-image=\fR
or
\fB\-\-ephemeral\fR\&.
.sp
Note that this switch leaves host name, machine ID and all other settings that could identify the instance unmodified\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-x\fR, \fB\-\-ephemeral\fR

.RE
.sp
On GPT images, if an EFI System Partition (ESP) is discovered, it is automatically mounted to
/efi
(or
/boot
as fallback) in case a directory by this name exists and is empty\&.
.sp
Partitions encrypted with LUKS are automatically decrypted\&. Also, on GPT images dm\-verity data integrity hash partitions are set up if the root hash for them is specified using the
\fB\-\-root\-hash=\fR
option\&.
.sp
Any other partitions, such as foreign partitions or swap partitions are not mounted\&. May not be specified together with
\fB\-\-directory=\fR,
\fB\-\-template=\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-root\-hash=\fR
.RS 4
Takes a data integrity (dm\-verity) root hash specified in hexadecimal\&. This option enables data integrity checks using dm\-verity, if the used image contains the appropriate integrity data (see above)\&. The specified hash must match the root hash of integrity data, and is usually at least 256 bits (and hence 64 formatted hexadecimal characters) long (in case of SHA256 for example)\&. If this option is not specified, but the image file carries the
"user\&.verity\&.roothash"
extended file attribute (see
\fBxattr\fR(7)), then the root hash is read from it, also as formatted hexadecimal characters\&. If the extended file attribute is not found (or is not supported by the underlying file system), but a file with the
\&.roothash
suffix is found next to the image file, bearing otherwise the same name, the root hash is read from it and automatically used, also as formatted hexadecimal characters\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-a\fR, \fB\-\-as\-pid2\fR
.RS 4
Invoke the shell or specified program as process ID (PID) 2 instead of PID 1 (init)\&. By default, if neither this option nor
\fB\-\-boot\fR
is used, the selected binary is run as process with PID 1, a mode only suitable for programs that are aware of the special semantics that the process with PID 1 has on UNIX\&. For example, it needs to reap all processes reparented to it, and should implement
\fBsysvinit\fR
compatible signal handling (specifically: it needs to reboot on SIGINT, reexecute on SIGTERM, reload configuration on SIGHUP, and so on)\&. With
\fB\-\-as\-pid2\fR
a minimal stub init process is run as PID 1 and the selected binary is executed as PID 2 (and hence does not need to implement any special semantics)\&. The stub init process will reap processes as necessary and react appropriately to signals\&. It is recommended to use this mode to invoke arbitrary commands in containers, unless they have been modified to run correctly as PID 1\&. Or in other words: this switch should be used for pretty much all commands, except when the command refers to an init or shell implementation, as these are generally capable of running correctly as PID 1\&. This option may not be combined with
\fB\-\-boot\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-boot\fR
.RS 4
Automatically search for an init binary and invoke it as PID 1, instead of a shell or a user supplied program\&. If this option is used, arguments specified on the command line are used as arguments for the init binary\&. This option may not be combined with

This is for containers which have several bootable directories in them; for example, several

Sets the machine name for this container\&. This name may be used to identify this container during its runtime (for example in tools like
\fBmachinectl\fR(1)
and similar), and is used to initialize the container\*(Aqs hostname (which the container can choose to override, however)\&. If not specified, the last component of the root directory path of the container is used, possibly suffixed with a random identifier in case
\fB\-\-ephemeral\fR

.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-private\-users=\fR
.RS 4
Controls user namespacing\&. If enabled, the container will run with its own private set of UNIX user and group ids (UIDs and GIDs)\&. This involves mapping the private UIDs/GIDs used in the container (starting with the container\*(Aqs root user 0 and up) to a range of UIDs/GIDs on the host that are not used for other purposes (usually in the range beyond the host\*(Aqs UID/GID 65536)\&. The parameter may be specified as follows:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2
.\}
If one or two colon\-separated numbers are specified, user namespacing is turned on\&. The first parameter specifies the first host UID/GID to assign to the container, the second parameter specifies the number of host UIDs/GIDs to assign to the container\&. If the second parameter is omitted, 65536 UIDs/GIDs are assigned\&.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  2." 4.2
.\}
If the parameter is omitted, or true, user namespacing is turned on\&. The UID/GID range to use is determined automatically from the file ownership of the root directory of the container\*(Aqs directory tree\&. To use this option, make sure to prepare the directory tree in advance, and ensure that all files and directories in it are owned by UIDs/GIDs in the range you\*(Aqd like to use\&. Also, make sure that used file ACLs exclusively reference UIDs/GIDs in the appropriate range\&. If this mode is used the number of UIDs/GIDs assigned to the container for use is 65536, and the UID/GID of the root directory must be a multiple of 65536\&.
.RE

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 4.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  4." 4.2
.\}
The special value
"pick"
turns on user namespacing\&. In this case the UID/GID range is automatically chosen\&. As first step, the file owner of the root directory of the container\*(Aqs directory tree is read, and it is checked that it is currently not used by the system otherwise (in particular, that no other container is using it)\&. If this check is successful, the UID/GID range determined this way is used, similar to the behavior if "yes" is specified\&. If the check is not successful (and thus the UID/GID range indicated in the root directory\*(Aqs file owner is already used elsewhere) a new \(en currently unused \(en UID/GID range of 65536 UIDs/GIDs is randomly chosen between the host UID/GIDs of 524288 and 1878982656, always starting at a multiple of 65536\&. This setting implies
\fB\-\-private\-users\-chown\fR
(see below), which has the effect that the files and directories in the container\*(Aqs directory tree will be owned by the appropriate users of the range picked\&. Using this option makes user namespace behavior fully automatic\&. Note that the first invocation of a previously unused container image might result in picking a new UID/GID range for it, and thus in the (possibly expensive) file ownership adjustment operation\&. However, subsequent invocations of the container will be cheap (unless of course the picked UID/GID range is assigned to a different use by then)\&.
.RE
.sp
It is recommended to assign at least 65536 UIDs/GIDs to each container, so that the usable UID/GID range in the container covers 16 bit\&. For best security, do not assign overlapping UID/GID ranges to multiple containers\&. It is hence a good idea to use the upper 16 bit of the host 32\-bit UIDs/GIDs as container identifier, while the lower 16 bit encode the container UID/GID used\&. This is in fact the behavior enforced by the
\fB\-\-private\-users=pick\fR
option\&.
.sp
When user namespaces are used, the GID range assigned to each container is always chosen identical to the UID range\&.
.sp
In most cases, using
\fB\-\-private\-users=pick\fR
is the recommended option as it enhances container security massively and operates fully automatically in most cases\&.
.sp
Note that the picked UID/GID range is not written to
/etc/passwd
or
/etc/group\&. In fact, the allocation of the range is not stored persistently anywhere, except in the file ownership of the files and directories of the container\&.
.sp
Note that when user namespacing is used file ownership on disk reflects this, and all of the container\*(Aqs files and directories are owned by the container\*(Aqs effective user and group IDs\&. This means that copying files from and to the container image requires correction of the numeric UID/GID values, according to the UID/GID shift applied\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-private\-users\-chown\fR
.RS 4
If specified, all files and directories in the container\*(Aqs directory tree will adjusted so that they are owned to the appropriate UIDs/GIDs selected for the container (see above)\&. This operation is potentially expensive, as it involves descending and iterating through the full directory tree of the container\&. Besides actual file ownership, file ACLs are adjusted as well\&.
.sp
This option is implied if
\fB\-\-private\-users=pick\fR
is used\&. This option has no effect if user namespacing is not used\&.

Hence, each bridge interface configured this way exists only as long as there\*(Aqs at least one container referencing it running\&. This option is very similar to
\fB\-\-network\-bridge=\fR, besides this automatic creation/removal of the bridge device\&.
.sp
This setting makes it easy to place multiple related containers on a common, virtual Ethernet\-based broadcast domain, here called a "zone"\&. Each container may only be part of one zone, but each zone may contain any number of containers\&. Each zone is referenced by its name\&. Names may be chosen freely (as long as they form valid network interface names when prefixed with
"vz\-"), and it is sufficient to pass the same name to the
\fB\-\-network\-zones=\fR
switch of the various concurrently running containers to join them in one zone\&.
.sp
Note that
\fBsystemd-networkd.service\fR(8)
includes by default a network file
/usr/lib/systemd/network/80\-container\-vz\&.network
matching the bridge interfaces created this way, which contains settings to enable automatic address provisioning on the created virtual network via DHCP, as well as automatic IP routing onto the host\*(Aqs external network interfaces\&. Using
\fB\-\-network\-zone=\fR
is hence in most cases fully automatic and sufficient to connect multiple local containers in a joined broadcast domain to the host, with further connectivity to the external network\&.

"auto"\&. If
"no", the journal is not linked\&. If
"host", the journal files are stored on the host file system (beneath

"guest", the journal files are stored on the guest file system (beneath

"try\-host"

do the same but do not fail if the host does not have persistent journaling enabled\&. If
"auto"
(the default), and the right subdirectory of

Takes one of: a path argument\ \&\(em in which case the specified path will be mounted from the host to the same path in the container, or a colon\-separated pair of paths\ \&\(em in which case the first specified path is the source in the host, and the second path is the destination in the container, or a colon\-separated triple of source path, destination path and mount options\&. The source path may optionally be prefixed with a

/var/tmp
directory is used\&. It is automatically removed when the container is shut down\&. Mount options are comma\-separated and currently, only
\fBrbind\fR
and
\fBnorbind\fR
are allowed, controlling whether to create a recursive or a regular bind mount\&. Defaults to "rbind"\&. Backslash escapes are interpreted, so
"\e:"

Mount a tmpfs file system into the container\&.

This option is particularly useful for mounting directories such as
/var
as tmpfs, to allow state\-less systems, in particular when combined with
\fB\-\-read\-only\fR\&. Backslash escapes are interpreted in the path, so
"\e:"
may be used to embed colons in the path\&.
.RE
.PP
\fB\-\-overlay=\fR, \fB\-\-overlay\-ro=\fR
.RS 4
Combine multiple directory trees into one overlay file system and mount it into the container\&. Takes a list of colon\-separated paths to the directory trees to combine and the destination mount point\&.
.sp
Backslash escapes are interpreted in the paths, so
"\e:"
may be used to embed colons in the paths\&.
.sp
If three or more paths are specified, then the last specified path is the destination mount point in the container, all paths specified before refer to directory trees on the host and are combined in the specified order into one overlay file system\&. The left\-most path is hence the lowest directory tree, the second\-to\-last path the highest directory tree in the stacking order\&. If
\fB\-\-overlay\-ro=\fR
is used instead of
\fB\-\-overlay=\fR, a read\-only overlay file system is created\&. If a writable overlay file system is created, all changes made to it are written to the highest directory tree in the stacking order, i\&.e\&. the second\-to\-last specified\&.
.sp
If only two paths are specified, then the second specified path is used both as the top\-level directory tree in the stacking order as seen from the host, as well as the mount point for the overlay file system in the container\&. At least two paths have to be specified\&.
.sp
The source paths may optionally be prefixed with
"+"
character\&. If so they are taken relative to the image\*(Aqs root directory\&. The uppermost source path may also be specified as empty string, in which case a temporary directory below the host\*(Aqs
/var/tmp
is used\&. The directory is removed automatically when the container is shut down\&. This behaviour is useful in order to make read\-only container directories writable while the container is running\&. For example, use the
"\-\-overlay=+/var::/var"
option in order to automatically overlay a writable temporary directory on a read\-only
/var
directory\&.
.sp
For details about overlay file systems, see
\m[blue]\fBoverlayfs\&.txt\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[4]\d\s+2\&. Note that the semantics of overlay file systems are substantially different from normal file systems, in particular regarding reported device and inode information\&. Device and inode information may change for a file while it is being written to, and processes might see out\-of\-date versions of files at times\&. Note that this switch automatically derives the
"workdir="
mount option for the overlay file system from the top\-level directory tree, making it a sibling of it\&. It is hence essential that the top\-level directory tree is not a mount point itself (since the working directory must be on the same file system as the top\-most directory tree)\&. Also note that the
"lowerdir="
mount option receives the paths to stack in the opposite order of this switch\&.

/usr
from the OS tree is mounted into it in read\-only mode (the system thus starts up with read\-only OS image, but pristine state and configuration, any changes are lost on shutdown)\&. When the mode parameter is specified as
\fBstate\fR, the OS tree is mounted read\-only, but
/var
is mounted as a
"tmpfs"

This option provides similar functionality for containers as the

.sp
If enabled (the default), a settings file named after the machine (as specified with the
\fB\-\-machine=\fR
setting, or derived from the directory or image file name) with the suffix
\&.nspawn
is searched in
/etc/systemd/nspawn/

/run/systemd/nspawn/\&. If it is found there, its settings are read and used\&. If it is not found there, it is subsequently searched in the same directory as the image file or in the immediate parent of the root directory of the container\&. In this case, if the file is found, its settings will be also read and used, but potentially unsafe settings are ignored\&. Note that in both these cases, settings on the command line take precedence over the corresponding settings from loaded
\&.nspawn
files, if both are specified\&. Unsafe settings are considered all settings that elevate the container\*(Aqs privileges or grant access to additional resources such as files or directories of the host\&. For details about the format and contents of
\&.nspawn

\fBsystemd.nspawn\fR(5)\&.
.sp
If this option is set to
\fBoverride\fR, the file is searched, read and used the same way, however, the order of precedence is reversed: settings read from the
