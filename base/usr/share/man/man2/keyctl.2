No glibc wrapper is provided for this system call; see NOTES.
.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR keyctl ()
allows user-space programs to perform key manipulation.

The operation performed by
.BR keyctl ()
is determined by the value of the
.I operation
argument.
Each of these operations is wrapped by the
.I libkeyutils
library (provided by the
.I keyutils
package) into individual functions (noted below)
to permit the compiler to check types.

The permitted values for
.I operation
are:
.TP
.BR KEYCTL_GET_KEYRING_ID " (since Linux 2.6.10)"
Map a special key ID to a real key ID for this process.

This operation looks up the special key whose ID is provided in
.I arg2
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t ).
If the special key is found,
the ID of the corresponding real key is returned as the function result.
The following values may be specified in
.IR arg2 :
.RS
.TP
.B KEY_SPEC_THREAD_KEYRING
This specifies the calling thread's thread-specific keyring.
See
.BR thread-keyring (7).
.TP
.B KEY_SPEC_PROCESS_KEYRING
This specifies the caller's process-specific keyring.
See
.BR process-keyring (7).
.TP
.B KEY_SPEC_SESSION_KEYRING
This specifies the caller's session-specific keyring.
See
.BR session-keyring (7).
.TP
.B KEY_SPEC_USER_KEYRING
This specifies the caller's UID-specific keyring.
See
.BR user-keyring (7).
.TP
.B KEY_SPEC_USER_SESSION_KEYRING
This specifies the caller's UID-session keyring.
See
.BR user-session-keyring (7).
.TP
.BR KEY_SPEC_REQKEY_AUTH_KEY " (since Linux 2.6.16)"
.\"            commit b5f545c880a2a47947ba2118b2509644ab7a2969
This specifies the authorization key created by
.BR request_key (2)
and passed to the process it spawns to generate a key.
This key is available only in a
.BR request-key (8)-style
program that was passed an authorization key by the kernel and
ceases to be available once the requested key has been instantiated; see
.BR request_key (2).
.TP
.BR KEY_SPEC_REQUESTOR_KEYRING " (since Linux 2.6.29)"
.\"            commit 8bbf4976b59fc9fc2861e79cab7beb3f6d647640
This specifies the key ID for the
.BR request_key (2)
destination keyring.
This keyring is available only in a
.BR request-key (8)-style
program that was passed an authorization key by the kernel and
ceases to be available once the requested key has been instantiated; see
.BR request_key (2).
.RE
.IP
The behavior if the key specified in
.I arg2
does not exist depends on the value of
.I arg3
(cast to
.IR int ).
If
.I arg3
contains a non-zero value, then\(emif it is appropriate to do so
(e.g., when looking up the user, user-session, or session key)\(ema new key
is created and its real key ID returned as the function result.
.\" The keyctl_get_keyring_ID.3 page says that a new key
.\" "will be created *if it is appropriate to do so**. What is the
.\" determiner for appropriate?
.\" David Howells: Some special keys such as KEY_SPEC_REQKEY_AUTH_KEY
.\" wouldn't get created but user/user-session/session keyring would
.\" be created.
Otherwise, the operation fails with the error
.BR ENOKEY .

If a valid key ID is specified in
.IR arg2 ,
and the key exists, then this operation simply returns the key ID.
If the key does not exist, the call fails with error
.BR ENOKEY .

The caller must have
.I search
permission on a keyring in order for it to be found.

The arguments
.IR arg4
and
.IR arg5
are ignored.

This operation is exposed by
.I libkeyutils
via the function
.BR keyctl_get_keyring_ID (3).
.TP
.BR KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING " (since Linux 2.6.10)"
Replace the session keyring this process subscribes to with
a new session keyring.
.\" This may be useful in conjunction with some sort of
.\" session management framework that is employed by the application.

If
.I arg2
is NULL,
an anonymous keyring with the description "_ses" is created
and the process is subscribed to that keyring as its session keyring,
displacing the previous session keyring.

Otherwise,
.I arg2
(cast to
.IR "char\ *" )
is treated as the description (name) of a keyring,
and the behavior is as follows:
.RS
.IP * 3
If a keyring with a matching description exists,
the process will attempt to subscribe to that keyring
as its session keyring if possible;
if that is not possible, an error is returned.
In order to subscribe to the keyring,
the caller must have
.I search
permission on the keyring.
.IP *
If a keyring with a matching description does not exist,
then a new keyring with the specified description is created,
and the process is subscribed to that keyring as its session keyring.
.RE
.IP
The arguments
.IR arg3 ,
.IR arg4 ,
and
.IR arg5
are ignored.

This operation is exposed by
.I libkeyutils
via the function
.BR keyctl_join_session_keyring (3).
.TP
.BR KEYCTL_UPDATE " (since Linux 2.6.10)"
Update a key's data payload.

The
.I arg2
argument (cast to
.IR key_serial_t )
specifies the ID of the key to be updated.
The
.I arg3
argument (cast to
.IR "void\ *" )
points to the new payload and
.I arg4
(cast to
.IR size_t )
contains the new payload size in bytes.

The caller must have
.I write
permission on the key specified and the key type must support updating.

A negatively instantiated key (see the description of
.BR KEYCTL_REJECT )
can be positively instantiated with this operation.

The
.I arg5
argument is ignored.

This operation is exposed by
.I libkeyutils
via the function
.BR keyctl_update (3).
.TP
.BR KEYCTL_REVOKE " (since Linux 2.6.10)"
Revoke the key with the ID provided in
.I arg2
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t ).
The key is scheduled for garbage collection;
it will no longer be findable,
and will be unavailable for further operations.
Further attempts to use the key will fail with the error
.BR EKEYREVOKED .

The caller must have
.IR write
or
.IR setattr
permission on the key.
.\" Keys with the KEY_FLAG_KEEP bit set cause an EPERM
.\" error for KEYCTL_REVOKE. Does this need to be documented?
.\" David Howells: No significance for user space.

The arguments
.IR arg3 ,
.IR arg4 ,
and
.IR arg5
are ignored.

This operation is exposed by
.I libkeyutils
via the function
.BR keyctl_revoke (3).
.TP
.BR KEYCTL_CHOWN " (since Linux 2.6.10)"
Change the ownership (user and group ID) of a key.

The
.I arg2
argument (cast to
.IR key_serial_t )
contains the key ID.
The
.I arg3
argument (cast to
.IR uid_t )
contains the new user ID (or \-1 in case the user ID shouldn't be changed).
The
.I arg4
argument (cast to
.IR gid_t )
contains the new group ID (or \-1 in case the group ID shouldn't be changed).

The key must grant the caller
.I setattr
permission.

For the UID to be changed, or for the GID to be changed to a group
the caller is not a member of, the caller must have the
.B CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capability (see
.BR capabilities (7)).

If the UID is to be changed, the new user must have sufficient
quota to accept the key.
The quota deduction will be removed from the old user
to the new user should the UID be changed.

The
.I arg5
argument is ignored.

This operation is exposed by
.I libkeyutils
via the function
.BR keyctl_chown (3).
.TP
.BR KEYCTL_SETPERM " (since Linux 2.6.10)"
Change the permissions of the key with the ID provided in the
.I arg2
argument (cast to
.IR key_serial_t )
to the permissions provided in the
.I arg3
argument (cast to
.IR key_perm_t ).

If the caller doesn't have the
.B CAP_SYS_ADMIN
capability, it can change permissions only for the keys it owns.
(More precisely: the caller's filesystem UID must match the UID of the key.)

The key must grant
.I setattr
permission to the caller
.IR regardless
of the caller's capabilities.
.\" FIXME Above, is it really intended that a privileged process can't
.\" override the lack of the 'setattr' permission?

The permissions in
.IR arg3
specify masks of available operations
for each of the following user categories:
.RS
.TP
.IR possessor " (since Linux 2.6.14)"
.\" commit 664cceb0093b755739e56572b836a99104ee8a75
This is the permission granted to a process that possesses the key
(has it attached searchably to one of the process's keyrings);
see
.BR keyrings (7).
.TP
.IR user
This is the permission granted to a process
whose filesystem UID matches the UID of the key.
.TP
.IR group
This is the permission granted to a process
whose filesystem GID or any of its supplementary GIDs
matches the GID of the key.
.TP
.IR other
This is the permission granted to other processes
that do not match the
.IR user
and
.IR group
categories.
.RE
.IP
The
.IR user ,
.IR group ,
and
.IR other
categories are exclusive: if a process matches the
.IR user
category, it will not receive permissions granted in the
.IR group
category; if a process matches the
.I user
or
.IR group
category, then it will not receive permissions granted in the
.IR other
category.

The
.I possessor
category grants permissions that are cumulative with the grants from the
.IR user ,
.IR group ,
or
.IR other
category.

Each permission mask is eight bits in size,
with only six bits currently used.
The available permissions are:
.RS
.TP
.IR view
This permission allows reading attributes of a key.

This permission is required for the
.BR KEYCTL_DESCRIBE
operation.

The permission bits for each category are
.BR KEY_POS_VIEW ,
.BR KEY_USR_VIEW ,
.BR KEY_GRP_VIEW ,
and
.BR KEY_OTH_VIEW .
.TP
.IR read
This permission allows reading a key's payload.

This permission is required for the
.BR KEYCTL_READ
operation.

The permission bits for each category are
.BR KEY_POS_READ ,
.BR KEY_USR_READ ,
.BR KEY_GRP_READ ,
and
.BR KEY_OTH_READ .
.TP
.IR write
This permission allows update or instantiation of a key's payload.
For a keyring, it allows keys to be linked and unlinked from the keyring,

This permission is required for the
.BR KEYCTL_UPDATE ,
.BR KEYCTL_REVOKE ,
.BR KEYCTL_CLEAR ,
.BR KEYCTL_LINK ,
and
.BR KEYCTL_UNLINK
operations.

The permission bits for each category are
.BR KEY_POS_WRITE ,
.BR KEY_USR_WRITE ,
.BR KEY_GRP_WRITE ,
and
.BR KEY_OTH_WRITE .
.TP
.IR search
This permission allows keyrings to be searched and keys to be found.
Searches can recurse only into nested keyrings that have
.I search
permission set.

This permission is required for the
.BR KEYCTL_GET_KEYRING_ID ,
.BR KEYCTL_JOIN_SESSION_KEYRING ,
.BR KEYCTL_SEARCH ,
and
.BR KEYCTL_INVALIDATE
operations.

The permission bits for each category are
.BR KEY_POS_SEARCH ,
.BR KEY_USR_SEARCH ,
.BR KEY_GRP_SEARCH ,
and
.BR KEY_OTH_SEARCH .
.TP
.IR link
This permission allows a key or keyring to be linked to.

This permission is required for the
.BR KEYCTL_LINK
and
.BR KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT
operations.

The permission bits for each category are
.BR KEY_POS_LINK ,
.BR KEY_USR_LINK ,
.BR KEY_GRP_LINK ,
and
.BR KEY_OTH_LINK .
.TP
.IR setattr " (since Linux 2.6.15)."
This permission allows a key's UID, GID, and permissions mask to be changed.

This permission is required for the
.BR KEYCTL_REVOKE ,
.BR KEYCTL_CHOWN ,
and
.BR KEYCTL_SETPERM
operations.

The permission bits for each category are
.BR KEY_POS_SETATTR ,
.BR KEY_USR_SETATTR ,
.BR KEY_GRP_SETATTR ,
and
.BR KEY_OTH_SETATTR .
.RE
.IP
As a convenience, the following macros are defined as masks for
all of the permission bits in each of the user categories:
.BR KEY_POS_ALL ,
.BR KEY_USR_ALL,
.BR KEY_GRP_ALL ,
and
.BR KEY_OTH_ALL .

The
.IR arg4 " and " arg5
arguments are ignored.

This operation is exposed by
.I libkeyutils
via the function
.BR keyctl_setperm (3).
.TP
.BR KEYCTL_DESCRIBE " (since Linux 2.6.10)"
Obtain a string describing the attributes of a specified key.

The ID of the key to be described is specified in
.I arg2
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t ).
The descriptive string is returned in the buffer pointed to by
.I arg3
(cast to
.IR "char\ *" );
.I arg4
(cast to
.IR size_t )
specifies the size of that buffer in bytes.

The key must grant the caller
.I view
permission.

The returned string is null-terminated and
contains the following information about the key:

.in +4n
.IR type ; uid ; gid ; perm ; description
.in

In the above,
.IR type
and
.IR description
are strings,
.IR uid
and
.IR gid
are decimal strings, and
.I perm
is a hexadecimal permissions mask.
The descriptive string is written with the following format:

    %s;%d;%d;%08x;%s

.BR "Note: the intention is that the descriptive string should"
.BR "be extensible in future kernel versions".
In particular, the
.IR description
field will not contain semicolons;
.\" FIXME But, the kernel does not enforce the requirement
.\" that the key description contains no semicolons!
.\" So, user space has no guarantee here??
.\" Either something more needs to be said here,
.\" or a kernel fix is required.
it should be parsed by working backwards from the end of the string
to find the last semicolon.
This allows future semicolon-delimited fields to be inserted
in the descriptive string in the future.

Writing to the buffer is attempted only when
.IR arg3
is non-NULL and the specified buffer size
is large enough to accept the descriptive string
(including the terminating null byte).
'\" Function commentary says it copies up to buflen bytes, but see the
'\" (buffer && buflen >= ret) condition in keyctl_describe_key() in
'\" security/keyctl.c
In order to determine whether the buffer size was too small,
check to see if the return value of the operation is greater than
.IR arg4 .

The
.I arg5
argument is ignored.

This operation is exposed by
.I libkeyutils
via the function
.BR keyctl_describe (3).
.TP
.B KEYCTL_CLEAR
Clear the contents of (i.e., unlink all keys from) a keyring.

The ID of the key
(which must be of keyring type)
.\" or the error ENOTDIR results
is provided in
.I arg2
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t ).
.\" According to Documentation/security/keys.txt:
.\"     This function can also be used to clear special kernel keyrings if they
.\"     are appropriately marked if the user has CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability.  The
.\"     DNS resolver cache keyring is an example of this.

The caller must have
.I write
permission on the keyring.

The arguments
.IR arg3 ,
.IR arg4 ,
and
.IR arg5
are ignored.

This operation is exposed by
.I libkeyutils
via the function
.BR keyctl_clear (3).
.TP
.BR KEYCTL_LINK " (since Linux 2.6.10)"
Create a link from a keyring to a key.

The key to be linked is specified in
.IR arg2
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t );
the keyring is specified in
.IR arg3
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t ).

If a key with the same type and description is already linked in the keyring,
then that key is displaced from the keyring.

Before creating the link,
the kernel checks the nesting of the keyrings and returns appropriate errors
if the link would produce a cycle
or if the nesting of keyrings would be too deep
(The limit on the nesting of keyrings is determined by the kernel constant
.BR KEYRING_SEARCH_MAX_DEPTH ,
defined with the value 6, and is necessary to prevent overflows
on the kernel stack when recursively searching keyrings).

The caller must have
.I link
permission on the key being added and
.I write
permission on the keyring.

The arguments
.IR arg4
and
.IR arg5
are ignored.

This operation is exposed by
.I libkeyutils
via the function
.BR keyctl_link (3).
.TP
.BR KEYCTL_UNLINK " (since Linux 2.6.10)"
Unlink a key from a keyring.

The ID of the key to be unlinked is specified in
.I arg2
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t );
the ID of the keyring from which it is to be unlinked is specified in
.I arg3
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t ).

If the key is not currently linked into the keyring, an error results.

The caller must have
.I write
permission on the keyring from which the key is being removed.

If the last link to a key is removed,
then that key will be scheduled for destruction.

The arguments
.IR arg4
and
.IR arg5
are ignored.

This operation is exposed by
.I libkeyutils
via the function
.BR keyctl_unlink (3).
.TP
.BR KEYCTL_SEARCH " (since Linux 2.6.10)"
Search for a key in a keyring tree,
returning its ID and optionally linking it to a specified keyring.

The tree to be searched is specified by passing
the ID of the head keyring in
.IR arg2
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t ).
The search is performed breadth-first and recursively.

The
.I arg3
and
.I arg4
arguments specify the key to be searched for:
.I arg3
(cast as
.IR "char\ *" )
contains the key type
(a null-terminated character string up to 32 bytes in size,
including the terminating null byte), and
.I arg4
(cast as
.IR "char\ *" )
contains the description of the key
(a null-terminated character string up to 4096 bytes in size,
including the terminating null byte).

The source keyring must grant
.I search
permission to the caller.
When performing the recursive search, only keyrings that grant the caller
.I search
permission will be searched.
Only keys with for which the caller has
.I search
permission can be found.

If the key is found, its ID is returned as the function result.

If the key is found and
.I arg5
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t )
is nonzero, then, subject to the same constraints and rules as
.BR KEYCTL_LINK ,
the key is linked into the keyring whose ID is specified in
.IR arg5 .
If the destination keyring specified in
.I arg5
already contains a link to a key that has the same type and description,
then that link will be displaced by a link to
the key found by this operation.

Instead of valid existing keyring IDs, the source
.RI ( arg2 )
and destination
.RI ( arg5 )
keyrings can be one of the special keyring IDs listed under
.BR KEYCTL_GET_KEYRING_ID .
.IP
This operation is exposed by
.I libkeyutils
via the function
.BR keyctl_search (3).
.TP
.BR KEYCTL_READ " (since Linux 2.6.10)"
Read the payload data of a key.

The ID of the key whose payload is to be read is specified in
.I arg2
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t ).
This can be the ID of an existing key,
or any of the special key IDs listed for
.BR KEYCTL_GET_KEYRING_ID .
.\" including KEY_SPEC_REQKEY_AUTH_KEY

The payload is placed in the buffer pointed by
.I arg3
(cast to
.IR "char\ *" );
the size of that buffer must be specified in
.I arg4
(cast to
.IR size_t ).

The returned data will be processed for presentation
according to the key type.
For example, a keyring will return an array of
.I key_serial_t
entries representing the IDs of all the keys that are linked to it.
The
.IR "user"
key type will return its data as is.
If a key type does not implement this function,
the operation fails with the error
.BR EOPNOTSUPP .

If
.I arg3
is not NULL,
as much of the payload data as will fit is copied into the buffer.
On a successful return,
the return value is always the total size of the payload data.
To determine whether the buffer was of sufficient size,
check to see that the return value is less than or equal to
the value supplied in
.IR arg4 .

The key must either grant the caller
.I read
permission, or grant the caller
.I search
permission when searched for from the process keyrings
(i.e., the key is possessed).

The
.I arg5
argument is ignored.

This operation is exposed by
.I libkeyutils
via the function
.BR keyctl_read (3).
.TP
.BR KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE " (since Linux 2.6.10)"
(Positively) instantiate an uninstantiated key with a specified payload.

The ID of the key to be instantiated is provided in
.I arg2
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t ).

The key payload is specified in the buffer pointed to by
.I arg3
(cast to
.IR "void\ *");
the size of that buffer is specified in
.I arg4
(cast to
.IR size_t ).

The payload may be a NULL pointer and the buffer size may be 0
if this is supported by the key type (e.g., it is a keyring).

The operation may be fail if the payload data is in the wrong format
or is otherwise invalid.

If
.I arg5
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t )
is nonzero, then, subject to the same constraints and rules as
.BR KEYCTL_LINK ,
the instantiated key is linked into the keyring whose ID specified in
.IR arg5 .

The caller must have the appropriate authorization key,
and once the uninstantiated key has been instantiated,
the authorization key is revoked.
In other words, this operation is available only from a
.BR request-key (8)-style
program.
See
.BR request_key (2)
for an explanation of uninstantiated keys and key instantiation.

This operation is exposed by
.I libkeyutils
via the function
.BR keyctl_instantiate (3).
.TP
.BR KEYCTL_NEGATE " (since Linux 2.6.10)"
Negatively instantiate an uninstantiated key.

This operation is equivalent to the call:

    keyctl(KEYCTL_REJECT, arg2, arg3, ENOKEY, arg4);

The
.I arg5
argument is ignored.

This operation is exposed by
.I libkeyutils
via the function
.BR keyctl_negate (3).
.TP
.BR KEYCTL_SET_REQKEY_KEYRING " (since Linux 2.6.13)"
Set the default keyring to which implicitly requested keys
will be linked for this thread, and return the previous setting.
Implicit key requests are those made by internal kernel components,
.\" I.e., calls to the kernel's internal request_key() interface,
.\" which is distinct from the request_key(2) system call (which
.\" ultimately employs the kernel-internal interface).
such as can occur when, for example, opening files
on an AFS or NFS filesystem.
Setting the default keyring also has an effect when requesting
a key from user space; see
.BR request_key (2)
for details.

The
.I arg2
argument (cast to
.IR int )
should contain one of the following values,
to specify the new default keyring:
.RS
.TP
.BR KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_NO_CHANGE
Don't change the default keyring.
This can be used to discover the current default keyring
(without changing it).
.TP
.BR KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_DEFAULT
This selects the default behaviour,
which is to use the thread-specific keyring if there is one,
otherwise the process-specific keyring if there is one,
otherwise the session keyring if there is one,
otherwise the UID-specific session keyring,
otherwise the user-specific keyring.
.TP
.BR KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_THREAD_KEYRING
Use the thread-specific keyring
.RB ( thread-keyring (7))
as the new default keyring.

.BR KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_SESSION_KEYRING
Use the session-specific keyring
.RB ( session-keyring (7))
as the new default keyring.
.TP
.BR KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_USER_KEYRING
Use the UID-specific keyring
.RB ( user-keyring (7))
as the new default keyring.
.TP
.BR KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_USER_SESSION_KEYRING
Use the UID-specific session keyring
.RB ( user-session-keyring (7))
as the new default keyring.
.TP
.BR KEY_REQKEY_DEFL_REQUESTOR_KEYRING " (since Linux 2.6.29)"

.BR KEYCTL_SET_TIMEOUT " (since Linux 2.6.16)"
Set a timeout on a key.

The ID of the key is specified in
.I arg2
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t ).
The timeout value, in seconds from the current time,
is specified in
.I arg3
(cast to
.IR "unsigned int" ).
The timeout is measured against the realtime clock.

Specifying the timeout value as 0 clears any existing timeout on the key.

The
.I /proc/keys
file displays the remaining time until each key will expire.
(This is the only method of discovering the timeout on a key.)

The caller must either have the
.I setattr
permission on the key
or hold an instantiation authorization token for the key (see
.BR request_key (2)).

The key and any links to the key will be
automatically garbage collected after the timeout expires.
Subsequent attempts to access the key will then fail with the error
.BR EKEYEXPIRED .

This operation cannot be used to set timeouts on revoked, expired,
or negatively instantiated keys.

.TP
.BR KEYCTL_ASSUME_AUTHORITY " (since Linux 2.6.16)"
Assume (or divest) the authority for the calling thread
to instantiate a key.

The
.I arg2
argument (cast to
.IR key_serial_t )
specifies either a nonzero key ID to assume authority,
or the value 0 to divest authority.

If
.I arg2
is nonzero, then it specifies the ID of an uninstantiated key for which
authority is to be assumed.
That key can then be instantiated using one of
.BR KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE ,
.BR KEYCTL_INSTANTIATE_IOV ,
.BR KEYCTL_REJECT ,
or
.BR KEYCTL_NEGATE .
Once the key has been instantiated,
the thread is automatically divested of authority to instantiate the key.

Authority over a key can be assumed only if the calling thread has present
in its keyrings the authorization key that is
associated with the specified key.
(In other words, the
.BR KEYCTL_ASSUME_AUTHORITY
operation is available only from a
.BR request-key (8)-style
program; see
.BR request_key (2)
for an explanation of how this operation is used.)
The caller must have
.I search
permission on the authorization key.

If the specified key has a matching authorization key,
then the ID of that key is returned.
The authorization key can be read
.RB ( KEYCTL_READ )
to obtain the callout information passed to
.BR request_key (2).

If the ID given in
.I arg2
is 0, then the currently assumed authority is cleared (divested),
and the value 0 is returned.

The
.BR KEYCTL_ASSUME_AUTHORITY
mechanism allows a program such as
.BR request-key (8)
to assume the necessary authority to instantiate a new uninstantiated key
that was created as a consequence of a call to
.BR request_key (2).

Get the LSM (Linux Security Module) security label of the specified key.

The ID of the key whose security label is to be fetched is specified in
.I arg2
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t ).
The security label (terminated by a null byte)
will be placed in the buffer pointed to by
.I arg3
argument (cast to
.IR "char\ *" );
the size of the buffer must be provided in
.I arg4
(cast to

If
.I arg3
is specified as NULL or the buffer size specified in
.IR arg4
is too small, the full size of the security label string
(including the terminating null byte)
is returned as the function result,
and nothing is copied to the buffer.

The caller must have
.I view

The returned security label string will be rendered in a form appropriate
to the LSM in force.
For example, with SELinux, it may look like:

    unconfined_u:unconfined_r:unconfined_t:s0-s0:c0.c1023

Replace the session keyring to which the

subscribes with the session keyring of the calling process.
.\" What is the use case for KEYCTL_SESSION_TO_PARENT?
.\" David Howells: the Process Authentication Groups people requested this,
.\" but then didn't use it; maybe there are no users.

The keyring will be replaced in the parent process at the point
where the parent next transitions from kernel space to user space.

The keyring must exist and must grant the caller
.I link
permission.
The parent process must be single-threaded and have
the same effective ownership as this process
and must not be set-user-ID or set-group-ID.
The UID of the parent process's existing session keyring (f it has one),
as well as the UID of the caller's session keyring
much match the caller's effective UID.

The fact that it is the parent process that is affected by this operation
allows a program such as the shell to start a child process that
uses this operation to change the shell's session keyring.
(This is what the
.BR keyctl (1)
.B new_session

Mark a key as negatively instantiated and set an expiration timer

This operation provides a superset of the functionality of the earlier
.BR KEYCTL_NEGATE
operation.

The ID of the key that is to be negatively instantiated is specified in
.I arg2
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t ).
The
.I arg3
(cast to
.IR "unsigned int" )
argument specifies the lifetime of the key, in seconds.
The
.I arg4

specifies the error to be returned when a search hits this key;
typically, this is one of
.BR EKEYREJECTED ,
.BR EKEYREVOKED ,
or
.BR EKEYEXPIRED .

If
.I arg5
(cast to
.IR key_serial_t )
is nonzero, then, subject to the same constraints and rules as
.BR KEYCTL_LINK ,
the negatively instantiated key is linked into the keyring
whose ID is specified in
.IR arg5 .

The caller must have the appropriate authorization key.
In other words, this operation is available only from a

If the value \-1 is specified, the caller's real user ID is used.
The ID of the destination keyring is specified in

.\" commit ddbb41148724367394d0880c516bfaeed127b52e
Compute a Diffie-Hellman shared secret or public key.

The
.I arg2
argument is a pointer to a set of parameters containing
serial numbers for three
.IR """user"""
keys used in the Diffie-Hellman calculation,
packaged in a structure of the following form:

.nf
.in +4n
struct keyctl_dh_params {
    int32_t private; /* The local private key */
    int32_t prime; /* The prime, known to both parties */
    int32_t base;  /* The base integer: either a shared
                      generator or the remote public key */
};
.in
.fi

Each of the three keys specified in this structure must grant the caller
.I read
permission.
The payloads of these keys are used to calculate the Diffie-Hellman
result as:

    base ^ private mod prime

If the base is the shared generator, the result is the local public key.
If the base is the remote public key, the result is the shared secret.

The
.I arg3
argument (cast to
.IR "char\ *" )
points to a buffer where the result of the calculation is placed.
The size of that buffer is specified in
.I arg4
(cast to
.IR size_t ).

The buffer must be large enough to accommodate the output data,
otherwise an error is returned.
If
.I arg4
is specified zero,
in which case the buffer is not used and
the operation returns the minimum required buffer size
(i.e., the length of the prime).

Diffie-Hellman computations can be performed in user space,
but require a multiple-precision integer (MPI) library.
Moving the implementation into the kernel gives access to
the kernel MPI implementation,
and allows access to secure or acceleration hardware.

Adding support for DH computation to the
.BR keyctl()
system call was considered a good fit due to the DH algorithm's use
for deriving shared keys;
it also allows the type of the key to determine
which DH implementation (software or hardware) is appropriate.

The
.I arg5
argument is reserved and must be 0.

.SH VERSIONS
This system call first appeared in Linux 2.6.10.
.SH CONFORMING TO
This system call is a nonstandard Linux extension.
.SH NOTES
No wrapper for this system call is provided in glibc.
A wrapper is provided in the
.IR libkeyutils
library.
When employing the wrapper in that library, link with
.IR \-lkeyutils .
However, rather than using this system call directly,
you probably want to use the various library functions
mentioned in the descriptions of individual operations above.
.SH EXAMPLE
The program below provide subset of the functionality of the
.BR request-key (8)
program provided by the
.I keyutils
package.
For informational purposes,
the program records various information in a log file.

As described in
.BR request_key (2),
the
.BR request-key (8)
program is invoked with command-line arguments that
describe a key that is to be instantiated.
The example program fetches and logs these arguments.
The program assumes authority to instantiate the requested key,
and then instantiates that key.

The following shell session demonstrates the use of this program.
In the session,
we compile the program and then use it to temporarily replace the standard
.BR request-key (8)
program.
(Note that temporarily disabling the standard
.BR request-key (8)
program may not be safe on some systems.)
While our example program is installed,
we use the example program shown in
.BR request_key (2)
to request a key.

.nf
.in +4n

$ \fB./t_request_key user mykey somepayloaddata\fP
Key ID is 20d035bf
$ \fBsudo mv /sbin/request\-key.backup /sbin/request\-key\fP
.in
.fi

Looking at the log file created by this program,
we can see the command-line arguments supplied to our example program:

.nf
.in +4n
$ \fBcat /tmp/key_instantiate.log \fP

Destination keyring:  256e6a6
Auth key description: .request_key_auth;1000;1000;0b010000;20d035bf
.in
.fi

The last few lines of the above output show that the example program
was able to fetch:
.IP * 3
the description of the key to be instantiated,
which included the name of the key
.RI ( mykey );
.IP *
the payload of the authorization key, which consisted of the data
.RI ( somepayloaddata )
passed to
.BR request_key (2);
.IP *
the destination keyring that was specified in the call to
.BR request_key (2);
and
.IP *
the description of the authorization key,
where we can see that the name of the authorization key matches
the ID of the key that is to be instantiated
.RI ( 20d035bf ).
.PP
The example program in
.BR request_key (2)
specified the destination keyring as
.BR KEY_SPEC_SESSION_KEYRING .
By examining the contents of
.IR /proc/keys ,
we can see that this was translated to the ID of the destination keyring
.RI ( 0256e6a6 )
shown in the log output above;
we can also see the newly created key with the name
.IR mykey
and ID
.IR 20d035bf .
