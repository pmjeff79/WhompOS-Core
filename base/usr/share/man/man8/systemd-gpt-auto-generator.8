.SH "NAME"
systemd-gpt-auto-generator \- Generator for automatically discovering and mounting root, /home and /srv partitions, as well as discovering and enabling swap partitions, based on GPT partition type GUIDs\&.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.PP
/usr/lib/systemd/system\-generators/systemd\-gpt\-auto\-generator
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
systemd\-gpt\-auto\-generator
is a unit generator that automatically discovers root,
/home,
/srv
and swap partitions and creates mount and swap units for them, based on the partition type GUIDs of GUID partition tables (GPT)\&. It implements the
\m[blue]\fBDiscoverable Partitions Specification\fR\m[]\&\s-2\u[1]\d\s+2\&. Note that this generator has no effect on non\-GPT systems, or where the directories under the mount points are already non\-empty\&. Also, on systems where the units are explicitly configured (for example, listed in
\fBfstab\fR(5)), the units this generator creates are overridden, but additional automatic dependencies might be created\&.
.PP
This generator will only look for root partitions on the same physical disk the EFI System Partition (ESP) is located on\&. It will only look for the other partitions on the same physical disk the root file system is located on\&. These partitions will not be searched on systems where the root file system is distributed on multiple disks, for example via btrfs RAID\&.
.PP
systemd\-gpt\-auto\-generator
is useful for centralizing file system configuration in the partition table and making manual configuration in
/etc/fstab
or suchlike unnecessary\&.
.PP
This generator looks for the partitions based on their partition type GUID\&. The following partition type GUIDs are identified:

The
/home
and
/srv
partitions may be encrypted in LUKS format\&. In this case, a device mapper device is set up under the names
/dev/mapper/home
and
/dev/mapper/srv\&. Note that this might create conflicts if the same partition is listed in
/etc/crypttab
with a different device mapper device name\&.
.PP
Mount and automount units for the EFI System Partition (ESP) are generated on EFI systems\&. The ESP is mounted to
/boot, unless a mount point directory
/efi
exists, in which case it is mounted there\&. Since this generator creates an automount unit, the mount will only be activated on\-demand, when accessed\&. On systems where
/boot
(or
/efi
if it exists) is an explicitly configured mount (for example, listed in
\fBfstab\fR(5)) or where the
/boot
(or
/efi) mount point is non\-empty, no mount units are generated\&.
.PP
When using this generator in conjunction with btrfs file systems, make sure to set the correct default subvolumes on them, using
\fBbtrfs subvolume set\-default\fR\&.
